## Game developer, enthusiastic programmer and newbie artist

Yo, I am experienced Godot Engine developer! Gamedev is my fuelâš¡ and my dream, but I'm interested in large field of things!
I love:
- Game development (I am experienced game-jam participant)
- Drawing (I am newbie artist and I want to be an animator)
- Programming (It's like art, you draw your ideas)
- Math (A beautiful piece of science)

My skills:
- Godot Engine (experienced)
- Python (moderate)
- C++ (basic)
- HTML/CSS (websites landings)

Languages:
- Russian (Native)
- English (B1-B2, approved)
- Chinese (A1-A2, poorly)

I am targeting in:
- AI research / Data science / Machine learning (I love magic of AI, but mainly as a scientifical field, not tool)
- Drawing and animation (I love AI, but only when there is place for real human art)
- Development of dream-game

My biggest project is - **Lampotory** - virtual physical laboratory for education. A complex desktop application that I was supporting almost for 1 year
